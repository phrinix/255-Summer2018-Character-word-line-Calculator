hello We live in troubled times. The last few years have brought us a steady parade of fear
and panic in the headlines, boardrooms, and kitchen tables across America. Globalization,
outsourcing, downsizing, foreclosures, subprime mortgages and credit default swaps, ponzi
schemes, Wall Street fiascoes, recession. It’s just one piece of bad news after another.
During the first few months of 2009, U.S. company layoffs reached about a quartermillion
per month. As I write this in late 2009, unemployment is at 10.2 percent and
still rising, and underemployment (where your job stays in place but your hours and pay
are drastically cut back) is even worse. The rampant decline in gainful employment is a
ravaging epidemic to which few are immune. From executives and middle managers to
administration employees and blue-collar workers, from bankers to retail clerks, all are at
risk. Even the healthcare industry, until recently considered a job-safe zone, is trimming
away significant chunks of its workforce.
In the fall of 2008, a lot of people’s retirement portfolios suddenly lost half their
value or more. Real estate crashed. What people thought were their solid, reliable
assets turned out to be about as solid as water vapor. Job security is gone, a thing of
the past. In a 2009 USA Today survey, 60 percent of Americans polled said they see
today’s economic situation as the biggest crisis in their lifetime.
This shift away from reality opened the gates for the biggest economic boom in
history. Over the next three and a half decades, the American middle class exploded.
As the dollar devalued and the on-the-books value of real estate and other assets
inflated, ordinary people became millionaires. Suddenly credit was available to
anyone, anytime, anywhere, and credit cards began popping up like mushrooms after
a spring rain. To pay off those credit cards, Americans started using their homes as
ATMs, refinancing and borrowing, borrowing and refinancing.
